# Do I Need It?

`doineed.it` is a domain that lets anyone add their own decision tree for a service or product directly to the domain (e.g. `doineed.it/vpn`), helping others understand if they actually need something or not.

# Why?

Decision trees / flow chart questionnaires are a good way to help people understand if they need something or not. Most websites for creating decision trees are over engineered, closed source, pay walled, or otherwise cumbersome in some way and not easy to build on. Furthermore, they almost always use closed source code. `doineed.it` uses a completely open source JS script that allows anyone to create and style their own interactive decision tree page.

### Example use cases:

### doineed.it/vpn

Since not everyone actually needs a VPN, using one can introduce issues with online banking for example, and each VPN provider has different features, quality of service, and price points, it can be helpful to ask a series of questions first before providing an answer to the question "Do I need a VPN?". 

### doineed.it/blockchain

Since not every new tech solution actually needs a blockchain and can probably get by with either a centralized or distributed database, using one can introduce complexity and liabilities. It can be helpful to ask a series of questions first before providing an answer to the question "Do I need blockchain (for my project)?". 

### doineed.it/college

Since not everyone needs a college education in order to earn a living or be happy (e.g. someone who is not going to be a doctor, a lawyer, a scientist, etc), it can be helpful to ask a series of questions first before providing an answer to the question "Do I need college?".
